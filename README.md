# OTOKHI NOTE APP

A new Flutter project.

## API servers

Folders, notes, and attachments use `https://note.piisiit.com`. Folder creation
and updates send `POST /api/folder/save` with the logged-in user's bearer token.
Login, registration, and other account features use `https://chat.piisiit.com`.

To use a local Note server (the `piisiit_note_local` Postman variable), run:

```sh
flutter run --dart-define=PIISIIT_NOTE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Replace the example address with your Note server's address reachable from the
device. This override only changes the Note server; account requests still use
the Chat server. Restart the app after changing it.
